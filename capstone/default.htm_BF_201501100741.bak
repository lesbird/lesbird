GAMES ARCHIVE</big></big><br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-family: Courier;">On this page you can find the complete source code for the following games:<br>
<br>
Witchaven<br>
Witchaven II<br>
William Shatner's Tekwar<br>
Corridor 8: Galactic Wars (prototype)<br>
<br>
You can also find the following documents:<br>
<br>
Corridor 7: Alien Invasion game design document.<br>
Corridor 7: Alien Invasion strategy guide.<br>
<br>
<br>
I cannot guarantee that the source code will compile. From what I
remember, the compiler we used to build the games was Watcom C/C++ V9.5
and the target machine</span><span style="font-family: Courier;"> was
a 486 50+mhz running&nbsp;MS-DOS V5 or higher.</span><br style="font-family: Courier;">
<br style="font-family: Courier;">
<span style="font-family: Courier;">These games were
released by
Capstone Software prior to them folding in 1996. As a former Capstone
programmer I found these developer snapshots in my archives and by popular demand
I've decided to release it to the hobbyist community in hopes that the
games will be revived. I do not own the rights to these games. I do not know who
owns the rights to these games. To the best of my knowledge these
games are abandonware (or whatever you want to call it).<br>
<br>
It's possible that one or both of these scenarios has happened:<br>
<br>
1. Someone owns the rights and they don't care about the game anymore.
Did the owner of IntraCorp keep the assets and then move on to other
businesses and he just does not care about the games anymore?<br>
<br>
2. Someone owns the rights and they don't know they do. Did a bank
acquire all the assets from IntraCorp? Do they even know what they
have? Is it on a hard drive on some computer in some storage room?<br style="font-family: Courier;">

</span><span style="font-family: Courier;">Please
note that these
archives are snapshots of the development folder. Some files are not
actually used in the retail version of the game. You will have to
figure out which files they are. In most cases you can just run a batch
file that will compile the code for you as long as you have the right
environment set up.</span><br style="font-family: Courier;">

Added Corridor 8: Galactic Wars source code. This code is for the
prototype of the sequel to Corridor 7. This prototype was from very
early in the development process and uses temp art from the game DOOM
and has only some test maps. For more information see the write up for
the prototype <a href="http://corridor7.tripod.com/corr8/index.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>
