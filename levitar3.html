<h3>Levitar 3D: Evolved</h3>
<strong>Levitar 3D: Evolved</strong> can best be described as Lunar Lander meets Gravitar. 
Your primary mission is to destroy all enemy defenses and collect fuel to stay alive. 
In addition, there are sub-missions that must be completed as well. 
Destroying some enemy defenses and transporting them to a collector platform can present you with additional technology and weapon upgrades. 
At the conclusion of each mission you must land your ship on the landing pad. 
Landings are rated based on impact velocity and will affect your pilot rating. 
Pilot ratings in turn affect your total end-of-level bonus.<br>
<br>
Enemy defenses consist of stationary particle cannons, mobile hover tanks and flying saucers. 
Enemy difficulty may increase after a completed mission.<br>
<br>
The game consists of 6 planetary bodies with each having 6 missions. 
At the start of each mission you are presented with a mission stat screen that explains the primary and secondary missions as well as the defenses you can expect to encounter. 
Any new technology collected during a mission will be researched and added to your ship's inventory.<br>
<br>
Your ship's weapon inventory begins with only a tractor beam and particle cannon. 
Along the way you'll collect additional weapons which consist of the static gun, rail gun, plasma gun, cluster bomb, big bomb, vortex bomb, sub-atomic bomb and EMP.<br>
<br>
Fuel can be replenished by using your ship's tractor beam on the enemy defenses or some fuel pods located through-out each level. 
Bonus points are awarded for collected items and fuel pods that are not destroyed upon completion of each level.<br>
<br>
The game is over when you run out of ships or if you run out of fuel.<br>
