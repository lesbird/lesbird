MamePlayer is a free&nbsp;M.A.M.E. graphical frontend. Once executed
it will parse the xml file generated by mame.exe and search the
"mame/roms" folder for available roms. It will also search the
"mameplayer/screens" folder for matching screenshot files (.png or
.bmp). Once the initial search is complete it displays a list of games
available to play and allows you to scroll through the list using the
keyboard, joystick or arcade controller of your M.A.M.E. machine.<br>




<br>



Here's how the frontend controls are mapped:<br>



<br>



</small></big><big style="font-family: monospace;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">UP_ARROW</span> or 8 = Scroll up<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



DOWN_ARROW</span> or 2 = Scroll down<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



LEFT_ARROW</span> or 4 = Move to previous alphabetical letter<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



RIGHT_ARROW</span> or 6 = Move to next alphabetical letter<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



ENTER</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">CTRL</span> = Launch game<br>




<br>




</small></big><big style="font-family: monospace;"><small>In addition to the keyboard controls above you can also use the mouse/trackball or joystick to scroll up and down the list.<br>



<br>



A screen saver is built into the frontend to prevent any kind of
monitor burn-in. The screen saver activates after 5 minutes of
inactivity only when you are within the frontend. If you launch a game
the screen saver does not activate. The screen saver merely randomly
picks a screenshot image and displays it every minute.<br>



<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW TO USE</span></big><br>

<br>

Download and install the following files:<br>

mame0115b.exe (or later)<br>

snap.zip (for Mame32)<br>
<br>
1. Install mame0115b.exe then unzip MamePlayer to the same folder.<br>
2. Unzip the screenshots (snap.zip) to the "mame/MamePlayer/screens" folder.<br>
3. Put your roms in the "mame/roms" folder.<br>
3. Type "mame -listxml &gt;list.xml" to generate the xml file.<br>
4. Run MamePlayer.exe<br>

<br>



<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><big style="font-weight: bold;">FILTERS</big><br>



<br>



</span>Filters are used to ignore (not display) certain games in the
list. With 6,000+ roms to choose from you most likely don't want them
all in the list. Also, some roms are adult-oriented and you probably
don't want them to be seen or played by other members of your family.
Adding a game to a filter will cause that game to not be displayed. My
technique to create a filter list is simply to filter all games by
pressing LSHIFT-F then on a game-by-game basis unfilter the game that I want in my list by pressing SHIFT-D.<br>



<br>



Here's a list of the filter keys:<br>



<br>



<span style="font-weight: bold;">LSHIFT-F</span> = Filter all games<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



LSHIFT-A</span> = Add the selected game to the filter list<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



LSHIFT-D</span> = Remove the filter for the selected game<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



LSHIFT-U</span> = Unfilter all games<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">



X</span> = Toggle filtered games on/off<br>




<br>




</small></big><big style="font-family: monospace;"><small>When filtered games are visible they will show up in red text.<br>


<br>


Joystick control from within the frontend (Xbox 360 controller):<br>


<br>


<span style="font-weight: bold;">LEFT-SHOULDER + RED</span> = Add the selected game to the filter list<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">


LEFT-SHOULDER + BLUE</span> = Remove the filter for the selected game<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">


RIGHT-SHOULDER</span> = Toggle filtered games on/off<br>



<br>



</small></big><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-family: monospace;"><big style="font-weight: bold;">SUMMARY</big><br>


<br>


</span><span style="font-family: monospace;">There are plenty of M.A.M.E. frontends to choose from and most
are more configurable than MamePlayer. In fact, MamePlayer is probably
the least configurable frontend out there. I've tried several
graphical&nbsp;frontends but they just seemed too complicated to setup&nbsp;the way I wanted so I decided to just write my own.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">



<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">


Here's what&nbsp;it will do:</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">



<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">


1) Shows a list of the games with a screenshot for the currently selected game.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">


2) Allows you to quickly navigate the list with an arcade controller or joystick.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">


3) Allows you to use it without the need for a keyboard and mouse.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">


4) Allows you to add your own games to the list using a Lua script file.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">


<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">

Here's what it won't do:</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">


<br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">

1) The layout is&nbsp;not configurable - you get what you get.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">

2) It won't do everything. It's designed to do one thing, list games and launch them.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">

3) The frontend controls are not configurable.</span><br style="font-family: monospace;">
<span style="font-family: monospace;">

4) The file paths are not configurable.</span><br>
