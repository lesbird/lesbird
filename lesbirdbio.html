<b>1990:</b><br>
Started programming professionally in <b>1990</b> when I was hired at <b>Galacticomm</b> to be a programmer/customer support rep for their <b>The MajorBBS</b> software.<br>
<br>
<b>1993:</b><br>
In <b>1993</b> I got my first break into the game industry when I was hired at <b>Capstone Software</b>.
While there I made several hit games for the company including <b>Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, William Shatner's Tekwar, Witchaven and Witchaven II</b>.
Capstone folded in 1996 when their bid for an IPO failed.<br>
<br>
<b>1996:</b><br>
Afterwards I went to work for <b>Microprose</b> in Hunt Valley Maryland.
I was hired as Lead Engineer for their first FPS game called <b>Klingon Honor Guard</b>.
We used the Unreal 1 game engine and we were the 2nd Unreal engine powered game to ship (1998) shortly after Unreal itself shipped.<br>
<br>
<b>1999:</b><br>
After Microprose I had an opportunity to start-up my own game company along with a few other co-workers, the company was known as <b>AWE Games</b>.
We shipped a TON of titles to retail, so many that I can't even remember them all.
But there were some notable titles such as <b>SpongeBob Operation Krabby Patty, Hot Wheels Mechanix Racing, Jimmy Neutron, Kids Next Door: Operation B.E.S.T.</b>, and many many more.<br>
<br>
<b>2010:</b><br>
After 10 years we closed up shop and I found some temporary work at a nearby game company called <b>Darkside Game Studios</b> (2010-2014).
It was there that I shipped my first iPhone game and I started doing it as a hobby ever since.<br>
<br>
<b>2014:</b><br>
In <b>2014</b> I joined <a href="https://www.magicleap.com">Magic Leap</a> to help them develop content for their custom Mixed Reality device.
I was promoted to the role of Lead Engineer and created some very compelling demos that we showed to investors.<br>
<br>
<b>2017:</b><br>
In <b>2017</b> I left Magic Leap and moved to Boston where I joined a company and some really awesome people to help solve some real world problems with some of the latest VR/MR technologies.<br>
