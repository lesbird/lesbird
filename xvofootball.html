X vs O Football - Football made simple!<br>
A unique take on the X & O Football game. 
Draw your own routes for your receivers then hike the ball and play. 
Try to beat the defense and score touchdowns. 
The game is played with a variable time limit of 2, 5 or 15 minutes, score as many points within this timeframe as possible. 
You will always play on the offense.<br>
<br>
The quarterback can run or pass the ball. 
A backwards pass can be thrown again - try plays like the flea flicker. 
Defense can intercept the ball which will reset the down. 
If a first down is not made after 4 tries you restart from the original line of scrimmage.<br>
<br>
Three difficulty levels: high school, college and pro. The harder the difficulty the higher the scores.<br>
<br>
Stats are accumulated such as total yards passing, total yards rushing, total touchdowns scored.<br>
<br>
SCORING:<br>
A passing touchdown will score 6 points and your team will be awarded points based on yards.<br>
A rushing touchdown will score 7 points and your team will be awarded points based on yards.<br>
