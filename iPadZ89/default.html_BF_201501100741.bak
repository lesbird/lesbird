<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Courier New">The Heathkit
H89 Emulator for the iPad includes the HDOS 3.0 operating system and
most of the original HUG library. This app emulates the Heathkit H89
8-bit computer from the early 80s. For more information on the Heathkit
H89 computer system visit the <a href="../sebhc/index.html" target="_blank">SEBHC</a> website.<br>
<br>
To familiarize yourself with the HDOS 3 operating system, download the PDF manual here:<br>
<a href="../sebhc/documentation/software/HDOS-3/HDOS_3_02_Reference_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">HDOS 3 Reference Manual</a><br>
<br>
This reference manual is also included with the iPad app.<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">HOW TO USE THE EMULATOR</span><br>
<br>
When you first launch the app you will see the Heathkit prompt (H:) at
the top of the screen. The system has been booted to the ROM and is
awaiting further commands. From here you want to select one of the
included disk images and boot to the operating system.<br>
<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
SELECT A DISK IMAGE</span><br>
<br>
Tap anywhere in the upper part of the screen to view the included disk images:<br>
<br>
</font><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="Heathkit H89 emulator for the iPad" src="screenshots/screen2.png"><br>
<br>
<font face="Courier New">Scroll the list by swiping up or down.<br>
<br>
Tap on the floppy drive button labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY0:</span> then tap on a disk image to insert into the emulated drive.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline;">BOOT TO THE HDOS OS</span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Important note:</span> When you boot a
distribution image for the first time it will appear that nothing is
happening. You will see the H: prompt with a blinking cursor. The HDOS
operating system is in the autobaud detect mode. Just tap the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SPACEBAR</span>
on the keyboard a few times to continue the boot process.<br>
<br>
To start off let's scroll down the list and select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">HDOS_3-02_1_System.h8d</span> disk image by tapping on it. Tap on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DONE</span> button to close the disk image library and then tap the <span style="font-weight: bold;">BOOT</span>
button to boot the emulator into the HDOS 3 operating system. You'll be
asked to enter the current date.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
Important node:</span> The HDOS
operating system is not Y2K compliant so you cannot enter a year that
is higher than 1999.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="HDOS 3 boot screen" src="screenshots/screen7.png"><br>
<br>
After you type in a date (or just tap <span style="font-weight: bold;">RETURN</span> to use the default) you will see the HDOS 3 prompt which looks like this:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">S:</span><br>
<br>
HDOS is now waiting for commands. The first thing to do is configure
HDOS for the type of terminal we are emulating, which is a Heathkit
H19. Do this by typing in the following command:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">SET TT: H19</span><br>
<br>
Then press <span style="font-weight: bold;">RETURN</span>. Now restart HDOS by typing in the following:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">BYE</span><br>
<br>
After you see the logoff screen tap the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RESET</span> button then tap the <span style="font-weight: bold;">BOOT</span> button. You should now see a boot screen that looks like this:<br>
<br>
</font><img style="width: 512px; height: 384px;" alt="Heathkit H89 emulator for the iPad" src="screenshots/screen3.png"><br>
<br>
<font face="Courier New">From the HDOS 3 prompt (S:) you can enter in
any HDOS 3 command (see the reference manual) or execute one of the
programs on the disk. All HDOS programs have an extension of .ABS and
can be run directly from the prompt. Just type the program name and
press the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RETURN</span> key.<br>
<br>
I've included some shortcut buttons for some of the more common HDOS commands. These are labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">MOUNT</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIR</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SET</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY0:</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY1:</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY2:</span>.
When you are at the S: prompt you can tap one of these shortcut buttons
and the command will be typed in for you. As an example, to get a
directory listing for the disk image in drive <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY1:</span> you can tap the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIR</span> button followed by the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY1:</span> button and then press the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RETURN</span> key.<br>
<br>
There's a slide switch at the bottom of the screen labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">2MHz</span>. By default this switch is in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OFF</span>
position. This means the emulation is running as fast as the iPad can
run it, which is pretty fast. Most of the time you probably want to
leave this switch in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">OFF</span> position but if you are playing any of the games you'll want to switch it <span style="font-weight: bold;">ON</span>. Sliding this switch to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">ON</span>
position will do two things. First, it will slow the emulator down to
run at approximately 2MHz which is close to the speed of the real
computer. Second it will turn off all filtering for the fonts so that
graphic characters will look correct.<br>
<br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">
HOW THE DISK IMAGE LIBRARY WORKS</span><br>
<br>
To view the disk image library just tap anywhere in the upper part of
the screen. The disk image library is split into 2 categories called <span style="font-weight: bold;">My Images</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">Distribution</span>.
The distribution section are disk images in their factory supplied
condition. These images are exact copies of the disks that you would
get from the factory, never booted and never written to. Once a disk
image is written to or used in anyway, it is copied and added to the <span style="font-weight: bold;">My Images</span> section. You can delete any disk image from the <span style="font-weight: bold;">My Images</span> section by swiping it and tapping on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">DELETE</span> button. You can never delete or write to a disk image that is in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Distribution</span> section. These are permanent unalterable backups.<br>
<br>
There are 3 emulated floppy drives labeled <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY0:</span>, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY1:</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY2:</span>. In most cases you want to insert a bootable operating system disk image into the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY0:</span> drive. You can then insert another disk in <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY1:</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY2:</span> and access it from the operating system. Do this by first mounting the disk from the HDOS S: prompt like this:<br>
<br>
S: <span style="font-weight: bold;">MOUNT SY1:</span><br>
<br>
But before you can do this you have to select a disk image and insert
it into the drive. Tap in the upper part of the screen to pull up the
disk image library then tap one of the drive letters, <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY1:</span> or <span style="font-weight: bold;">SY2:</span>,
then tap on a disk image to insert into that drive. Now you can mount
the disk using the above command and access it's contents from the HDOS
operating system.<br>
<br>
