<p align="center"><font face="Courier New"><strong>iBots
</strong>is
a turn-based web-game written in JavaScript and designed for the iPhone.</font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Courier New">The
object is to kill as many iBots (red spheres) as possible by moving your
blue sphere around the playfield and forcing the iBots to run into the
barriers. The iBots will always move towards you and will attempt to
avoid the barriers. If an iBot touches a barrier, the barrier will turn
red and the iBot will be destroyed. When a red barrier is touched again
by another iBot the barrier and the iBot will both be destroyed.</font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Courier New"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jump</span></font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Courier New">You
have a jump button that, when pressed, will jump you to a random
location in the playfield. This random location may be on top of a
barrier, in which case you will be destroyed and the iBots win. If you
start the game in an impossible situation you may jump as many times as
you want until you reach what you feel is a safe starting position.
These first jumps will be guaranteed to be safe positions until you
make your first move.</font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Courier New"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Moving</span></font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Courier New">Moving
your blue sphere is accomplished by simply touching your finger in an
empty space next to your sphere. You cannot move on top of a barrier,
only an empty space or you can choose to not move by touching&nbsp;your sphere.</font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Courier New"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Score</span></font></p>



<p align="center"><font face="Courier New">A
rating is computed based on the number of kills, number of wins and the number of games
played. When a game is completed (a win or a
lose) you can start the next game by pressing the <span style="font-style: italic;">Play</span> button. The <span style="font-style: italic;">Play</span>
button will only work if a game is won or lost - you cannot accidentally restart
in the middle of a game.</font></p>
