Directory layout should be as follows:

<project folder>
  |
   -- <eng1lib> folder
  |     |
         -- eng1lib source files go in here
  |
   -- <fueldepot3d> folder
        |
         -- fuel depot 3d source files go in here
        |
         -- <run> folder
              |
               -- copy the game files into this folder

Eng1lib is a DirectX game library written by me for Fuel Depot 3D and also
used for X and O Football.

When you build a new executable, it will be put into the run directory.

One environment variable is required (DX_ROOT) and should point to the DX8
SDK folder. See "setup.txt" in the eng1lib folder for more.

Note that I put eng1lib under the LGPL license. You may use it to create your
own games if you wish using the Fuel Depot 3D code as a basis, however, I
don't have the time to provide support for it.
