Fuel Depot 3D is a freeware game created using Direct3D and the D3DX
utilities.  It was inspired by the classic 1980 arcade game Rip-Off by
Tim Skelly and Cinematronics.  The objective of the game is to protect
the 10 fuel pods from the oncoming pirate ships.  The pirate ships will
attach the pods to their ship and drag them off.  Once the pirate ships
are far enough away with an attached fuel pod they'll warp out,
effectively stealing the pod.  When all 10 pods are gone the game is
over.

To protect the fuel pods you are given unlimited lives and 3 weapons as
described below:

Laser Canon: Unlimited ammo but you can only fire 5 shots at a time.

             Activate using the CTRL key or button #1 on your gamepad.

Nukes:       Destroys all pirate ships within it's blast radius.  You
             can pick up additional nukes on occasion when a pirate ship
             is destroyed and he drops a weapon sphere.

             Activate nukes by using the BACKSPACE key or button #2 on a
             gamepad.

Missiles:    Heat seeking missiles will track down pirate ships and
             destroy them.  If they impact a fuel pod the missile will
             be destroyed.  Again, additional missiles can be picked up
             on occasion from a weapon sphere that is randomly dropped
             by a destroyed pirate ship.

             Activate missiles by using the ENTER key or button #3 on
             a gamepad.

Your ship is also equipped with a turbo boost.  Use the X key or button
#4 on a gamepad to activate it.  You have a limited 10 second supply of
turbo boost but it will recharge when not in use.

Press the F1 key to toggle through the help screens during the game.
