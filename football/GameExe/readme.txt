HOW TO PLAY

Use a 6 button joystick or game controller to select plays and move
the player(s). The game always starts with the X team as the offense
and the O team as the defense. This is generally a 2 player game using
either 1 or 2 controllers - although you can play by yourself if you
want to play the offenses on both sides. If using 1 controller the
defense is controlled by the computer. When using 2 controllers each
player chooses their own plays on both offense and defense.  If the
play clock expires a 5 yard delay of game penalty will apply on
whichever team failed to select a play in time.


OFFENSE

In a single controller game simply pick your play by pressing the
appropriate button then press any button to hike the ball.  Pass to
one of three receivers: wide-out left, wide-out right or running back.
If you pass to the running back and stay behind the line of scrimmage
you can pass to either of the other two receivers.

In a 2 controller game each team picks a play and when all players are
lined up the offensive player presses any button to hike the ball and
the play begins.

In most cases during a pass play the left receiver will run a short
route and the right receiver will run a long route.  If you need short
yardage pass to the left.

Passing:
If you are unable to recognize the defensive lineup yet you can read
the coverage by watching the receivers once the ball is hiked.  If you
see loose coverage on the receivers the chances of completing a pass are
higher.  You may want to buy as much time in the pocket as possible so
the receivers have time to put distance between them and the defensive
players.  If you see tight coverage a pass will most likely be knocked
down or even intercepted.

Button 1: Pass to the left receiver
Button 2: Pass to the right receiver
Button 3: Pass to the running back

When the ball is in the air control switches to the receiver and a target
appears where the ball will land.  You should center your player as best
as possible on the target to complete a pass.  The closer you are to the
center the better the chances of catching the ball.  The target will
appear ahead of where the receiver is currently running and in most cases
you can catch the ball in full stride.

Kicking:
When a kick play is selected on the offense the buttons work as follows:

Button 1: Pass to the left receiver
Button 2: Pass to the right receiver
Button 3: Pass to the running back
Button 4: Punt the ball.
Button 5: Attempt a field goal

Of course you can always run the ball too.  When a kick play is selected
all offensive players are on the line of scrimmage except for the running
back and the quarterback.  Since more offensive players are blocking the
chances of making a successful run are higher.

Change of possession:
A change of possession happens when any of the following occur:

1. A ball is punted
2. A team scores a touchdown, field goal or safety
3. A pass is intercepted
4. The offense fails to convert a 4th down play


DEFENSE

In a single controller game the defensive play is randomly chosen by the
computer.

If the defense chooses the same play as the offense the coverage will be
extremely tight and the chances of completing a pass are slim. If the plays
are mismatched the offense has the advantage and coverage on the receivers
will be loose.


CONTROLS

Offensive and defensive plays:

Button 1: No play (use buttons 2 thru 6 to pick a play)
Button 2: Slant out
Button 3: Slant in
Button 4: Bomb
Button 5: Down and out
Button 6: Punt, field goal attempt, run or blitz
