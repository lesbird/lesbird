<span style="text-decoration: underline;">About the iBots</span><br>

<br>

The

iBots live on a planet far away. A planet made up entirely of machines.

During your space travels you've crash landed on their planet. The

iBots aren't happy about it. After all, you are not a machine and are

not compatible with their architecture.</span><span style="font-family: Courier New;"> They see you as a virus.</span><span style="font-family: Courier New;"> So they've assembled an

army

dedicated to hunting you down.<br>

<br>

<br>
iBots
aren't very smart. They can move in any direction but at first they
don't know
how to avoid obstacles very well. They will learn as time goes on and
as they upgrade their AI they will know how to avoid obstacles. They
get angry pretty easily
and when they do, they come straight at you ignoring everything in
their path.<br>

<br>

To survive, you need to trick them into running into

the walls. On occasion a power-up will appear that will help you defeat

the iBots. Hm... it appears that someone

or&nbsp;something&nbsp;on the

planet is trying to help you.<br>

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">About the Game</span><br>

<br>

</span><span style="font-family: Courier New;">iBots

is a turn based game of strategy.&nbsp;You make a move, then the

iBots

will make a move, and the cycle continues until all of the iBots are

dead or until they catch you. As time goes on they will learn how to avoid obstacles. They get smarter.<br>

2010.<br>
iBots 2 was completely rewritten and upgraded using Unity in 2017.<br>
